# Active Admin

Active Admin is a Ruby on Rails framework for creating elegant backends for website administration.

## State of the project

### 1.0.0
*Keep in mind that during the time where we use `pre`-release label, things can break in each release!*

## Goals

1. Enable developers to quickly create good-looking administration interfaces.
2. Build a DSL for developers and an interface for businesses.
3. Ensure that developers can easily customize every nook and cranny.
